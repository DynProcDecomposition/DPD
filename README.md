This project is for setting up a set of demos for the DPD project that will allow demonstrate it in code.
Here are the items needed to run it:

1. It is written in C# (good prototyping language) in Visual Studio 2015. You will need an environment. 
   If you do not have Visual Studio you can download the community edition (I use it) for free here:
https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs.aspx

2. For the visual output it uses DirectX. To get the correct version (directx_Jun2010_redist.exe):

3. To connect DirectX to the .net environment, the project uses SharpDX, an open source library you can find at:
